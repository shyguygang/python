    "content": "Subscribe\nThe single most important thing to remember\ng0hst.eth in the shell\n0x6841\nJuly 10th, 2024\nMint\nIs that context is key. Yes, it’s confusing, but by splitting my words up and not keying into any one service, I keep you all guessing and wanting more.\n\nAlso, let’s understand that I am no superhuman. I just level up my ability to infer. I ask questions I don’t have answers to, and then I go seek the answer. That’s all the magic there is.\nBy never giving any of you the same picture right away, it leaves room for objectification. Plus, knowing who is looking at one of these tools is important, but it’s even more important who knows about two and how they know about the other.\nLike Ms. Ada Twist, I need a puzzle, a quest!\nAlso, MS, do you like me again?
