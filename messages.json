But so is this idea of Arbitrage.\n\nMEV bots utilize lots of strategies to make all those assloads of asshole\u2019s money.\n\nArbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more markets; striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded.\n\nI own an MEV bot that connects to hundreds of exchanges via API. I own the newest, latest, crapcoin that\u2019s a gift from Pepe himself. I own the Uniswap LP. I have lots of \"relationships\" cough dealers, that have lots of customers who are degen gamblers, just not as experienced yet. I create and advertise crapcoin, I give liquidity to \"CEXs\" for free, so they can sell to their customers and I get a cut from all sales. The CEXs can only go through each other when there\u2019s enough volume or they can\u2019t sell to any customers.\n\nI start the tweet machine, and some of the volume picks up elsewhere. But it\u2019s a low amount of volume, more prone to wild swings in price. My bot, using data that no one gets nearly as quickly, makes trades across the entire shitcoin market ecosystem. No matter where the coin is purchased, I now control and dictate the price and it is extremely difficult to change a price that\u2019s sandwiched. Ask me how I know.\n\nNo matter who is doing it, Arbitrage is not fair to anyone else who does not also have the ability to arbitrage without automation and for free.

How are these companies still \"private?\" If they charge the Government only 50% more than cost, and consumers 100% more than they charge Government, and you call them Public Cloud Infrastructure, I\u2019m going to always be confused. One Datacenter does not only service one customer. I guess we kind of are all in this together.\n\n:/\n/end"]
